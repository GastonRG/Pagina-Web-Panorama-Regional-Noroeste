# VDS Regional Panorama Web Page (private client)

The purpose of the website is to show relevant information on a department called Cruz del Eje in the province of Cordoba, with information on the province, country and world.
The notes are loaded from an app called VDS Regional Panorama Manager, which is included in my projects.
The database is built on MYSQL. The CRUD is worked through the app.
Important code data
For security I have removed the name of the database, user and password.
Xxx = database name
yyy = password
zzz = user

This page is created with HTML, CSS, PHP, images in corel draw and programmed in Sublimetext3
